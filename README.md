# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
### Purpose
    The purpose of the project is to help develop a better understanding of handling large data 
    sets that need to be sorted out and broken down so that we can interpret the data sets as well as
    manipulate them in order to see the general trends that may possibly impact overall data distribution.

## School District Results

### School and District Summary 
    * The District is Affected by the number of schools, the number of students,  the budget, as well 
    as the average math and reading scores as well as their percentage, and the overall passing percentage.

    * The School Summary is affected by the school type, the number of students, as well as the budget 
    per student and the average math and reading scores plus their percentages, and finally, the overall passing percentage.

    * If we were to replace the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School, 
    then we will see that the results of Thomas High School overall will increase by a fair amount in 
    regards to overall scores, and in the math and reading section.
   
   ![After Replacement](https://github.com/tlin41390/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/THS%20after%20replacement.png)
   
    * Once we replace the 9th grade scores in Thomas High School, we see that there is a 
    jump in all scores for math and reading. Overall, the school improved 
    dramatically when the 0th graders were replaced.
    
    
### School District Summary
    * Overall, The Four Major Changes in the school district analysis, after updating the ninth grade scores, 
    is that the average math score for Charter schools, increased, as well as the average reading scores increased as well. 
    In additon the overall passing rate has increased because THS is a charter school. As for the  size of the school, the averages 
    for a school size around THS will increase when the overall results of THS scores increase as well. Moreover, if we are to look at
    the school data based on budget per person, because THS falls in the range of 630-644($638) the scores for that range will increase as well.
